## Audio Samples
Used with permission from [Slate Digital](https://slatedigital.com/edm-sample-pack-2020). Mixed in Audacity (open source audio editor).

## Next Steps
- Eliminate dependency on useSound custom hook
- Eliminate dependency on Bootstrap
- Add a different set of sounds for Excision
- Create sound objects through a higher order function (e.g. map())
- Make sounds only playable once (e.g. pressing the button again stops-starts the playback so that the same sound doesn't play concurrently)
